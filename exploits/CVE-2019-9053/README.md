## Modified exploit for CVE-2019-9053

This is a modified exploit for [CMS Made Simple (n.d.)](https://www.cmsmadesimple.org/) that takes advantage of a SQL injection vulnerability in a version of it that is less than 2.2.10. The exploit was originally written by [Scanu (2019)](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46635), but it failed when I tried to run it in a version of Python 3. I made minor modifications to Scanu's original script to fix some of the errors that came up.
