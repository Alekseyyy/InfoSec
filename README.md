# InfoSec Tooling

some hacking tools that I wrote

## Categories

* [/Exploits](./exploits): like the title suggests, exploit code to take advantage of bugs in software
* [/lxc](./lxc): Automation scripts for the deployment of Linux Containers (lxc)
* [/Reversing](./reversing)
* [/VX](./vx): silly 90s-style computer malware that I wrote ("VX" being slang for "Virus eXchange")
